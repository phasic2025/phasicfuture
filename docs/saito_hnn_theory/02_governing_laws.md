# Governing Laws of SAITO-Constrained HNN

The SAITO-Constrained HNN operates under three fundamental laws that ensure stability, efficiency, and structural integrity. These laws are inspired by principles from physics and economics, creating a robust framework for knowledge representation and computation.

## I. Geometric Law (ℛₚₕyₛ)

### Core Principle: Fixed Currency Rate (The Shape)
The system maintains a constant curvature in hyperbolic space, analogous to a fixed exchange rate in an economic system.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Fixed curvature: c_target ≈ 11.7 (derived from the Fine-Structure Constant, α)
- All geometric operations must preserve this curvature

**Implementation Impact:**
- Ensures consistent distance measurements
- Maintains the hierarchical structure of the knowledge representation
- Provides a stable foundation for economic transactions

## II. Dynamic Law (ℛ_Dyn)

### Core Principle: Hard Price Limit (The Speed)
Information transfer is constrained by a maximum transaction cost, similar to the speed of light in physics.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Maximum transaction cost: d_max
- For any two connected nodes i and j: d_c(i,j) ≤ d_max
- Where d_c is the hyperbolic distance function with curvature c

**Implementation Impact:**
- Prevents inefficient computations
- Enforces locality in the network
- Creates natural boundaries for information propagation

## III. Topological Law (ℛ_Topo)

### Core Principle: Regulatory Fine (Structural Integrity)
The system imposes costs for structural changes that could compromise the global knowledge graph's integrity.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Cost_Structural = λ₁·|Δb₀| + λ₂·|Δb₁| + λ₃·Var(Curvature_local)
- Where b₀ and b₁ are Betti numbers (topological invariants)
- Var(Curvature_local) measures local geometric stability

**Implementation Impact:**
- Prevents excessive fragmentation of the knowledge graph
- Maintains global structural coherence
- Encourages efficient use of computational resources

## Interplay of the Laws

These three laws work together to create a self-regulating system:
1. The Geometric Law provides the foundational structure
2. The Dynamic Law enforces efficient computation
3. The Topological Law maintains system-wide stability

Together, they ensure that the network remains efficient, stable, and capable of representing complex hierarchical relationships while operating within the constraints of physical and economic reality.
